## Difference between `call()`, `bind()`, and `apply()` in JavaScript

|Function|Description                                                               |
|------- |------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|call()  |Calls a function with a specific value for the this keyword and additional arguments passed in as separate arguments.|
|bind()  |Returns a new function that, when called, has a specific value for the this keyword and additional arguments pre-filled (or "bound") to the function. The original function is not called until the new function is called. |
|apply() |Calls a function with a specific value for the this keyword and additional arguments passed in as an array.|
